This report is intended to permit the user to satisfy one of the requirements to qualify for the innocent landowner, contiguous property owner, or bona fide prospective purchaser limitations on Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation Liability Act (CERCLA) liability. This report will also satisfy the requirement for conducting All Appropriate Inquiry (AAI) into the prior ownership and use of the subject property consistent with good commercial or customary practice, as well as to qualify for protections against liability under the innocent landowner, bona fide prospective purchaser, and contiguous property owner defense.",
    "Description4": "This assessment will consist of the following: Conduct an on-site reconnaissance of the property, including a cursory review of adjacent properties. This will involve pertinent interviews with owners/occupants, property managers, or neighboring businesses to determine historical uses of the property and nearby properties. Additionally, a review of various Local, State, Federal, and Tribal databases will be conducted to help identify RECs in connection with the subject property and nearby properties. The search will include all databases required by ASTM E1527-21, covering minimal required search distances from the center of the subject property and several supplemental databases. Finally, a comprehensive report will be prepared, detailing the assessment findings and including supporting documentation.",
