This will involve pertinent interviews with owners/occupants, property managers, or neighboring businesses to determine historical uses of the property and nearby properties. Additionally, a review of various Local, State, Federal, and Tribal databases will be conducted to help identify RECs in connection with the subject property and nearby properties. The search will include all databases required by ASTM E1527-21, covering minimal required search distances from the center of the subject property and several supplemental databases. Finally, a comprehensive report will be prepared, detailing the assessment findings and including supporting documentation.",

The EA will follow the format accepted by CCRFCD on past similar projects and will describe the purpose and need for the project, describe the Proposed Action and alternatives, provide a project description, provide a discussion of the affected environment, describe environmental consequences of the Proposed Action, propose mitigation measures for identified impacts, as appropriate, and include names and addresses of neighboring property owners.",
    "Methods4": "UES will evaluate baseline conditions and determine site-specific environmental impacts using tiering from the SEIS. The initial evaluation will identify potential impacts as described in Chapter 8. Resources likely impacted by the proposed facility will be analyzed primarily through SEIS charts and maps, minimizing the need for extensive field surveys. Evaluated resources include Geology and Soils, Groundwater Hydrology, Visual Resources, Socioeconomics, Land Use, Air Quality, Noise, Environmental Justice, and Surface Water (assuming no US Army Corps permit required).\n\nCultural resources will be assessed by a professional archaeologist registered in Nevada, with a literature search deemed sufficient due to the city street alignment, assuming no historic properties need evaluation. For Biological Resources, a field reconnaissance will be conducted to check for migratory birds, desert tortoise, and other sensitive species.",
